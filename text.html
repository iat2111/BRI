<p>Early in December 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei (China&rsquo;s largest telecom equipment producer), was arrested in Canada at the behest of the United States. That same night Trump and Xi Jinping dined in Buenos Aires after the G20 Summit, where they agreed on a 90-day trade truce to a still ongoing trade war. Meanwhile, American authorities linked Meng&rsquo;s arrest to Huawei&rsquo;s violations of US sanctions against Iran. Meng&rsquo;s arrest in Vancouver through American extradition was warranted on the grounds of US national security.<a id='three' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are we so afraid of?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei is the only company that can currently produce all elements of the fifth-generation (5G) network. Thus, Huawei&rsquo;s control over 5G is rationalized as a threat to US national security. So underlying the claim of Huawei&rsquo;s violations of US sanctions against Iran is deep-seated anxiety over who will control the next digital frontier. As nation-states decide <em>who</em> will build their 5G networks, the US has embarked on a campaign to prevent China from taking part. At the Munich Security Conference in February (2019), current Vice President Mike Pence made his case for &ldquo;America First.&rdquo; In his speech, he made many political demands, most notably urging US allies to forgo the purchases of Russian arms and the installation of 5G communications networks by Huawei. Pence said that &ldquo;We [the US] cannot ensure the degense of the West if our allies grow dependent on the East.&rdquo;<a id='three' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Have our digital communication networks always been so balkanized? In March (of 2019), only a month Pence&rsquo;s speech, Italy, a US ally, &ldquo;de[fied] its allies [the US]&rdquo; by joining China&rsquo;s massive infrastructure-making project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).<a id='three' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US&rsquo; longing for technological supremacy translates into a spectacle of tactical maneuvers and grand political power plays. In this profane collapse of public spectacle and military intelligence, the very threat of war is used to sustain a desire to extend the extractive capacities of our information data streams and to procure more resources to maintain control over the digital in the name of security. The Huawei case, the media argues, signals a new US-China Cold War.<a id='three' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Bunker Archeology, </em>the theorist and philosopher Paul Virilio described what he saw in the works of the Third Reich&rsquo;s Atlantic Wall (in the aftermath of World War II) a <em>total war</em> reveled in its mythic dimensions of time, space, and technology.<a id='three' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Virilio argued that the speed of arms and the constant desire for control over military space has transformed conflict into a war of <em>real time, </em>supplanting the war of <em>real space </em>in geographical territories that has long ago conditioned the history of nations and people. <a id='three' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> He described the horizons of a future war based on &ldquo;the split between reality&mdash;the materialness of the human habitat&mdash;and unreality&mdash;the immaterialness of a power that is founded only on the violence of energy and on the ever-expanding extension of its field. From now on the military establishment will <strong>defend not so much the &lsquo;national&rsquo; territory as that of energy, the area of violence</strong>.&rdquo; <a id='three' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Virilio uncannily foresaw the so-called US-China Cold War. Yet, if the threat of 5G (the threat of a new Cold War) is one that supplants the war of <em>real space</em>, then what is left of architecture?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virilio later wrote in (date) about an even purer war from that of total war, a <em>pure war of speed</em> waged against humanity by technology itself. In these later reflections, the centrality of architecture, in the figure of the bunker, disappears. And in his last interview, Virilio even said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quitting architecture&hellip;it&rsquo;s finished, over. Curtain.&rdquo;<a id='three' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this essay argues that &ldquo;immaterialness&rdquo; of 5G&rsquo;s power is precisely predicated upon a war of real-space. The 5G (and neoliberal) dream-worlds of seamlessness and optimization are not border-less nor body-less, but are predicated on the very conflict over bodies and space. The digital frontier <em>is </em>geographic and thus inextricably tied to architecture and its ordering within the ecological regime of capitalism. Indeed, ninety percent of our &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; transmission actually moves through wires&mdash;wires attached to cell towers that spew and receive data from satellites in outer-space. Underwater fiber-optic cables carry the bulk of international data traffic. Asia and Europe are connected via the Suez Canal through the SEA-ME-WE 3 system whose cable spans 39,000km long. Internet service disruptions are, quite literally, geographic. The Strait of Malacca and Suez Canal are &ldquo;heavily trafficked choke points<strong>,&rdquo; </strong>where too many wires pass through a too narrow maritime passage.<a id='three' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> And on more technical grounds what defines the workings of a cellular network like 5G includes how various material components like computer chips and antennas handle radio signals and exchange data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 5G network is the first network built for artificial intelligence (AI). Qualcomm, an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment corporation, predict the speeds of 5G as 20 times faster than current 4G networks. 5G is also designed to deliver a more reliable exchange of data, minimizing the lag&mdash;or latency&mdash;of earlier cellular networks that often drop bits of data deemed inessential to certain tasks. 5G signals a transformation in extractive data capacities that will enable the greater-use of technologies like sensors, robots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality devices, and other artificial intelligence tools.<a id='three' href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">In its new extractive and calculative capacities, 5G effectively displaces ecological crisis unto a belief in the compensatory power of technology. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This essay traces the buried infrastructural lines of China&rsquo;s BRI through a case-study of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. I situate the BRI within its blurry relations to coal, in the effort to recuperate the materiality, the heaviness of architecture, precisely defied by digital abstractions. An extractive specter of coal haunts the BRI&rsquo;s networked infrastructural lines, but is exorcised time and time again by the seemingly immaterial airwaves and feedback signals that flow above and below us. By staying within the difficulty of coal, the weight of the BRI&rsquo;s &ldquo;gray architecture&rdquo; comes closer into view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s &ldquo;Silk Road Economic Belt&rdquo; and &ldquo;21<sup>st</sup> century Maritime Silk Road&rdquo; is rather overwhelming in its breadth; it is a massive undertaking&mdash;an estimated $900 billion worth of projects are already planned or underway.<a id='three' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> The BRI supports infrastructure and investment projects in nearly 120 countries.<a id='three' href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BRI is heavily invested in coal. The BRI has invested in at least 240 new coal-based power plants in 25 BRI countries.<a id='three' href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> Ironically, when the US under Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement in (date), China reaffirmed its commitment and even reached its carbon target for 2020 three years ahead of schedule.<a id='three' href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Much of the writing on the BRI and coal importantly points to this kind of green-washing: the contradiction of China funding oil, coal, and gas oversees while pushing for sustainable resources in its heartland. More generally, the BRI is deemed a neo-colonialist project with its debt-trap diplomacy and quiet procurement of logistical power. Frequent comparisons made between the BRI and the US Marshall Plan. Indeed, the &ldquo;New Silk Road&rdquo; constitutes a curious inversion of the German imperialist project that first-coined the term &ldquo;silk road&rdquo; in 1877 when a certain Von Richtofen who was part of the Berlin geologic society drew together the lines of geology and capital in his &ldquo;Map of Central Asia.&rdquo;<a id='three' href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> Though the BRI should and must be read along such lines, the media in mobilizing this critique effectively produces a particular narrative that erases the very tensions and contradictions essential to understanding the larger political stakes (and possibilities) of the BRI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, last year (date), the comedian John Oliver hosted an entire late night show to China.<a id='three' href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Oliver ended his show with a parody of a BRI song that was originally published by<em>人民日报</em> (trans. <em>People&rsquo;s Daily</em>), the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.<a id='three' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> The original song reveals, aesthetically, an optimistic ideology of &ldquo;world prosperity&rdquo; (world peace) proffered upon a dystopic reality of logistical-infrastructure-making, a fantastical transnationalism of driving logics and infrastructure driving the &ldquo;progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; of humanity&rsquo;s bright future.<a id='three' href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> Through such ideology, the environment is put on the back-burner and ecological crisis is put on-hold&mdash;or in the very least displaced by the compensatory power of technology the BRI promises in its global infrastructure-making (endeavors) desires. In Oliver&rsquo;s parody, this ideology is subsumed under the banner of &ldquo;China&rdquo; as an autocracy under its forever-ruling leader, &ldquo;Xi.&rdquo; The complex entanglement of territorial, geopolitical, and economic practices and interests spanning multiple actors and players is reduced to the one-logic totality of Xi Jingping&rsquo;s agency.&nbsp; What about the incentives of ministries, banks, state-owned enterprises, and even the role of &ldquo;recipient&rdquo; countries? And critically, what about the social and political processes and struggles behind the BRI?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though perhaps obvious, China&rsquo;s Communist Party is a party that is only nominally communist. The Party (at least since the 1989 Tiananmen protests) acts like the managerial body for global capital. China&rsquo;s state-owned enterprises retain ultimate political allegiance to the Communist Party but its features serve the integral functions of a capitalist economy. Enterprises like Huawei are globally competitive (a testimony to the domination of capitalism and &ldquo;the West&rdquo; over other futures not made in this image) though never fully privatized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The capacity of the BRI to engender spaces, politics, and subjects cannot simply be reduced to a totality without tensions and contradictions. The BRI&rsquo;s flows of capital, labor power, and resources impact politics and social relations. A neo-colonial critique implies that the BRI constitutes a strategic rearrangement of territories, markets, and subjects through China&rsquo;s consolidation of influence and power into an exploitative hegemonic force on a global scale, but how exactly is this being carried out? What does its labor look like? And how are its spaces being ordered, managed, and controlled?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, Premier Li Keqiang, revealed a strategic plan for industrial modernization similar to Germany&rsquo;s &ldquo;Industry 4.0,&rdquo; called &ldquo;Made in China 2025.&rdquo; The plan basically outlines a manufacturing upgrade to move China&rsquo;s economy from the manufacturing of cheap goods to &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; fields like IT, robotics, green energy, aerospace, power equipment, new materials, pharmaceuticals, etc.<a id='three' href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> &ldquo;Made in China 2025&rdquo; conjures a grand vision of an innovative and sustainable future, but this vision is not without a major upheaval, a major restructuring of the class and labor (and thus their politics) subtending older manufacturing models. &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; constitutes a necessary transformation to already outmoded regulations of space and society; it draws together a strategy more-fit to the currents of a global neoliberal order that is perpetually changing. Such policies are inextricably tied to the larger global-vision of the BRI that dreams of monetizing and &ldquo;modernizing&rdquo; a labor force&nbsp;to be as transmissible as capital itself&mdash;these dreams reverberate in the creation of precarity (an economically vulnerable workforce) in the mobile surplus and labor that now extends across international borders. &ldquo;Made in China 2025&rdquo; thus like a fundamental lubricant for the logistical and infrastructural expansions proposed by the BRI. In her work on the architectures of &ldquo;extrastatecraft&rdquo;, Keller Easterling argues that this expansion is predicated on the emergence of &ldquo;zones&rdquo; (or Free Trade Zones, Foreign Trade Zones, Special Economic Zones, Export Processing Zones, etc.). Zones, Easterling contends, demonstrate the ways in which <em>cities</em> have become infrastructural. Architecture&rsquo;s preferred terrain, the urban space of cities, has become a mobile and monetized technology, a spatial product fueled by regimes of exception.<a id='three' href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shenzhen (across the Pearl River Delta north of Hong Kong) was the first Special Economic Zone (specifically an &ldquo;economic and technology development zone&rdquo; (经济技术开发区) established in China in 1980.<a id='three' href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> In the post-Mao era, the zoning <em>technology</em> created a zone of capitalist exception, offering autonomy from socialist regulation and special privileges to the region. Today, Shenzhen is a massive global electronic manufacturing hub. This initial zone of <em>exception </em>meant to attract foreign investment and foster technological upgrades, however, is now the new normal; Yet it has been naturalized to such an extent that the explicit designation of a <em>zone </em>is already outmoded. Zones have been rescaled to the bureaucratic complexities of master-manufacturing plans like &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo;&mdash; such rescaling forms the connective hinge from which the BRI&rsquo;s reconfigures geographies of production, accumulation, and innovation without even the explicit heading of zone creation and expansion. Subtending this zonal fever&nbsp;is the lines of resource extraction that stretch now along an entire network&mdash; a network that is perpetually expanding by way of the BRI&rsquo;s territorial logics, a territorial vision terrifyingly mobile in its power. According to mining.com, China has already cornered much of the world&rsquo;s supply of strategic metal and minerals crucial for technology-making (these are resources like rare earths, lithium, copper, and manganese).<a id='three' href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> The BRI&rsquo;s territorial vision simultaneously produces networks and logistical zones that form new geographies&mdash;a vision whose reconfiguring enacts precisely a conflict over bodies and over space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is one of the six economic corridors of the BRI proposes. CPEC connects Kashgar in China&rsquo;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with the deep-water port of Gwadar in (southern) Pakistan. As part of the BRI and CPEC, China has invested $46 billion dollars (a multi-year investment) in Pakistan&rsquo;s southern Balochistan region (Pakistan&rsquo;s largest province, stretching from the Arabian Sea coast through vast desert and mountains regions to Iran in the west and Afghanistan in the north) to fund projects like the deep-water port of Gwadar and a still incomplete power project, a 300 megawatt coal power plant 40km east of the port intended to supply energy to the city and the port, which currently runs on an intermittent supply from Iran.<a id='three' href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> The projects in Gwadar constitute an emerging logistical and economic <em>zone</em> in one of the least developed of Pakistan&rsquo;s regions yet one of the &ldquo;richest in natural resources like natural gas, oil, coal, copper, sulphur, fluoride, and gold.&rdquo;<a id='three' href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a> The region generates an estimated $1 billion a year for Pakistan&rsquo;s government.<a id='three' href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> Balochistan&rsquo;s long history of the violence of resource exploitation coincides with a long separatist movement. The Balochistan Liberation Army and other separatist groups active in the region are designated as terrorist organizations by the Pakistani government; this exceptional status warrants the use of force and state violence in the continued presence and occupation of the region by both military and para-military forces.<a id='three' href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Balochistan&rsquo;s assembly under Jam Kamal (Chief Minister to the region) recently (December 2018) adopted a resolution demanding the formation of a national commission to show that there has been an &ldquo;injudicious distribution of projects and funds under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.&rdquo;<a id='three' href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> Kamal has even announced that the region will no longer allow the ownership of land to be transferred to foreign companies. While Kamal acts in protest against Balochistan&rsquo;s meager share of CPEC benefits, his claim is at best troubling)&mdash;for Kamal was originally in agreement with government plans to expropriate land, demolish the old city, and resettle residents for the (BRI-funded) Port Gwadar construction project. Baloch separatists have supposedly injured and killed both Pakistanis and Chinese workers employed on CPEC projects.<a id='three' href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a> In response to these growing tensions, Pakistani authorities have responded with crackdowns on anti-CPEC protests, and security and surveillance measures. The BRI&rsquo;s logistical power&nbsp;<em>is</em> predicated upon a conflict over bodies and over space; it is predicated on the exploitation of labor and territory that operates at the intersections (rather than beyond) what has sometimes been cast as a geopolitical past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historical, political, social, and economic tensions of Balochistan are echoed in China&rsquo;s Xinjiang Autonomous Region which is also deemed indispensable for its abundant resources and strategic location vis-&agrave;-vis Central and South Asia. Consolidating power and control over this &ldquo;wild west&rdquo; has always been a historic and pressing concern for China, a historic tension which is today fueled by the political nature of Islam (for instance, the &ldquo;threat&rdquo; of Islamic radicalism).<a id='three' href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Uyghurs&rsquo; forced alienation, marginalization, and dispossession is a position of immense precarity. Xinjiang&rsquo;s geographical proximity to Pakistan (the two connected via the Kakakoram Highway) fuels China&rsquo;s anxiety over the infiltration of &ldquo;Islamic ideology&rdquo; into China&rsquo;s heartland; while historically, Pakistan has proved to be an all-too-willing ally to China&rsquo;s &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo; against the Uyghur populations.<a id='three' href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp; China has recently introduced a new policy of &ldquo;transforming&rdquo; Uyghur populations by detecting and exorcising &ldquo;three evil forces&rdquo; of &ldquo;religious extremism, ethnic separatism, and violent terrorism&rdquo; which are together described as &ldquo;ideological cancers.&rdquo; <a id='three' href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a> In 2015, the same year &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; was proposed, billions of dollars in government contracts were awarded to Chinese tech firms to build &ldquo;smart&rdquo; security systems across Xinjiang. At the 2017 China-Eurasia Security Expo in Urümchi, Xinjiang, a spokesperson for Leon Technology, one of the new players in the Chinese security industry,&nbsp;&nbsp; described how the inter-relations of the world&rsquo;s Muslim-majority nations with the BRI provides an &ldquo;unlimited market potential&rdquo; for population-control management technologies currently being developed for Xinjiang.<a id='three' href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in 2015, the same year &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; was proposed (and from which ensued an incentivizing of digital surveillance in Xinjiang), Pakistan signed unto more than 30 BRI-related deals with China.<a id='three' href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> The signing of the Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) happened just four months before one of Pakistan&rsquo;s largest blackouts of January of 2015, where 80% of Pakistan plunged into darkness. The government blamed Baloch separatists for the blackout, claiming a &lsquo;rebel attack&rsquo; managed to affect the country&rsquo;s entire power supply when in fact Pakistan had long been suffering from an energy crisis.<a id='three' href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> With China&rsquo;s help, Pakistan has built an entirely new energy sector from coal. In 2015, less than 1% of Pakistan&rsquo;s electricity was generated from coal.<a id='three' href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a> CPEC energy generation projects have added 14 gigawatts to Pakistan&rsquo;s existing 23 gigawatts of installed energy capacity. And coal now makes up about 70% of planned CPEC energy generation.<a id='three' href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the BRI, China defends not so much the territory of its heartland, but rather this territory of energy.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> But curiously,</span> much before coal was decisively betted-on as a new energy generation source for Pakistan&mdash;when CPEC appeared to be little more than a road link between Kashgar and Gwadar&mdash;4G fiber-optic connectivity featured prominently in talks, reports, and plans. The China-Pakistan fiber-optic project was first envisaged in 2007 (a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with China in April 2007) and its agreement was signed in 2013 (the year Xi Jingping first officially announced the BRI).<a id='three' href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a> The project spans 820 kilometers long from the Khunjerab pass at the China-Pakistan border to the city of Rawalpindi. Yet, the construction of the terrestrial fiber-optic cable was not officially launched until May 2016 when the two largest coal-fired plants, Sahiwal and Port Qasim, were already under construction.<a id='three' href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> In other words, the development of digital infrastructure <em>must</em> be read alongside coal. Coal is the material substrate that the BRI relies on to fuel the seemingly de-territorialized, seamless cyberspace of a larger terrestrial trans-Eurasian network (i.e. Transit Europe-Asia Terrestrial Cable network) of which the China-Pakistan fiber-optic project is just one part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The China-Pakistan fiber-optic project was inaugurated in July 2018. And for it, Pakistan took a 44-million-dollar concessional loan (at an interest rate of 2%) from China&rsquo;s Exim Bank.<a id='three' href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> The project is owned by the Pakistan&rsquo;s military-run SCO (Special Communications Organization), while its procurement and construction contractor is Huawei.<a id='three' href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a> The cable was built from Huawei telecom equipment. This expanded bandwidth, along with the construction of data centers to host this transfer of information, facilitated also the terrestrial broadcast of digital HD TV built by ZTE, another large telecom equipment vendor. The terrestrial-based cable allows both China and Pakistan to circumvent the crowded and unstable Strait of Malacca choke-point (with the port of Gwadar functioning as a new submarine landing station). For Pakistan and for China, the line provides an alternative to a network of submarine cables developed by a consortium of Indian companies.<a id='three' href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inauguration of the cable came days after China launched two satellites for Pakistan. The satellites will be used to provide remote sensing data for CPEC.<a id='three' href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a> This coalesces <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">also</span> with Pakistan&rsquo;s (privileged) use of China&rsquo;s satellite system, Beidou&mdash;a rival to military and government reliance on US-based GPS. The making and building of digital infrastructure in Pakistan is also closely tied to surveillance. Multiple &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; projects in Peshawar, Islamabad, Lahore, Punjab, Karachi, Quetta, and <strong>Gwadar</strong> are directly tied to the establishment of the terrestrial fiber-optic cable and existing Huawei infrastructure. For the Lahore &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; project, the Punjab government has entered in collaboration with Huawei to execute the installation of 8,000 cameras.<a id='three' href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a> This returns us again to Xinjiang, the site of brutal and heartbreaking applications of digital surveillance within the China&rsquo;s borders, whose technologies and techniques are now designed for export, reaching and moving along the BRI lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a stretch of the Kakakoram Highway before a series of BRI jointed funded tunnels above Attabad Lake, a large painted sign on a retaining wall reads &nbsp;&ldquo;Long Live Pak-China Friendship&rdquo; in English and in Chinese &ldquo;中巴友谊万岁,&rdquo; but curiously not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasta%CA%BFl%C4%ABq_script">Nastaʿlīq script</a> or Arabic.<a id='three' href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a> For <em>whom</em> is the sign intended? Perhaps only for tourists.<a id='three' href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a> The Kakakoram Highway spans 500 miles-long connecting Kashgar in China&rsquo;s Xinjiang region with Islamabad, Pakistan&rsquo;s capital. The Kakakoram Highway was built by both Pakistan and China <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(the highway is known in China as the Friendship Highway);</span> its construction dates back to 1959.<a id='three' href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a> The highway was constructed for the explicit purpose of fostering trade and peace in what is deemed an &ldquo;all weather&rdquo; friendship between China and Pakistan, but perhaps implicitly for enhancing political and logistical control over their territories against security threats (i.e. India).<a id='three' href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a> The northern section of the China-Pakistan fiber-optic project follows along the route of the Kakakoram Highway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a video &ldquo;Pakistan-China Fiber Optic Project&rdquo; originally produced by Pakistan&rsquo;s SCO, the highway makes frequent appearances&mdash;easily recognizable by the snow-covered peaks of the Kakakoram mountains. The video is a montage of footage shot from drones and from the ground with occasional stock graphics, images, video clips peppered in. It begins with traffic flows, robotic arms in a factory, a bursting lightbulb, data servers, interactive computer interfaces (one reading AI on its screen), a graphic of the earth showing lines of digital interconnectivity, radio transmission towers, and a submarine cable map showing not an underwater cable but rather a new terrestrial line. The video then shifts its focus to SCO workers: workers shown at the top of a radio transmission tower, workers trudging through the snow at the &ldquo;Junction of World&rsquo;s Three Highest Mountain Ranges,&rdquo; workers and heavy machinery along the Kakakoram Highway, more workers laying cables at the highest point in the Kakakoram mountains (the Khunjerab pass at the Pakistan-China border), workers in trucks climbing up narrow mountain passes, workers on bridges, workers working at night, and workers still working in <em>all weather</em> conditions (flooding). This part of the video is collaged with drone footage of mountains, rivers, and lakes. The video then switches back to cellphones, laptops, transmission towers, data centers, graphics of interconnectivity, and growth charts; then a collaged image of a train, a highway stretch, a hydroelectric dam, a coal power plant, and a natural landscape. The text &ldquo;e-governance,&rdquo; &ldquo;smart traffic,&rdquo; &ldquo;alternative international routing,&rdquo; &ldquo;security and surveillance,&rdquo; &ldquo;smart city&rdquo; then flashes across the screen. The video ends with a clip showing workers outfitted in yellow and orange vests and hardhats, some smiling others stoic, all holding a thumbs-up to the camera, and a final text that reads, &ldquo;transforming trade corridor into a digital corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the video is essentially promotional material for the SCO, it draws together quite beautifully the gray architecture of the BRI that reaches from the ground to the clouds above us. And the video crucially (and almost effortlessly) refigures labor into the BRI and (albeit unintentionally) emphasizes the very precarity of this labor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its logical and infrastructural lines, the BRI draws together a violent and hostile war carried out by other means&mdash;a war predicated on economic and technological advances that are said to usher in an era of world prosperity. This war is a war over real-space situated on the building of a gray architecture; it is seen in the exploitation and dispossession of peoples and the land they inhabit from Xinjiang to Balchostan; seen in the political maneuverings of governments and the deployment of their militaries said to protect a vision of world prosperity and an <em>all weather </em>friendship whose realities tell a much darker story. In this war over a gray architecture, coal quietly operates at the threshold of perception. This essay is a desperate attempt to hold onto it, but coal (as a material substrate and the social relations that are entangled with it) nonetheless feels sill like the most escapable object: coal slips out of view it and often with it disappears, too, the crucial voices of dissent and the class and labor politics supporting it. Yet, this messiness is not without benefit&mdash;by staying the difficulties, the tensions and contradictions of the material manifestation and entanglements of coal in the BRI, we glimpse (if only for a moment) a struggle that touches down on a gray architecture inextricably tied to land and the labor that builds it---a struggle that thus sets and stages political possibly. And perhaps this is the task of holding onto coal if only to lose it once more.</p>
